# TechCareer Bootcamp Task: Simple App Clone

This project is a part of the assignment for the Techcareer.com Bootcamp. The objective of the assignment was to choose an existing application and create a simple clone, focusing on implementing core features and UI components.

## Project Overview

For this project, I selected [sahibinden.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sahibinden&hl=tr) and implemented a basic version of its functionality. The application includes the following features:

- **Home Screen**: Displays categories and featured products.
- **Message Screen**: A simple interface for viewing and managing messages.
- **User Menu**: A section for managing user settings, account information, and preferences.

The project is built using Jetpack Compose and follows Material 3 design principles. It also incorporates ViewModel architecture to manage and persist UI-related data across configuration changes.

## Features Implemented

- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation between the Home, Message, and User Menu screens.
- **Reusable UI Components**: Custom composables for displaying categories and products.
- **ViewModel Integration**: Efficient data management using ViewModel and LiveData.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
